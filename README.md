# Car_Sales_Project

ðŸš— Car Sales Data Analytics Project! ðŸš—

I'm thrilled to present a comprehensive Car Sales Dashboard I developed using Power BI. This project was a deep dive into data cleaning, normalization, and visualization, aimed at helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

# Key Highlights:

Data Preparation: I started by cleaning and normalizing the data, ensuring accuracy and consistency. The data was organized into a star schema model for efficient analysis.
DAX Equations: Developed custom DAX equations to provide insights into key performance indicators such as Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) sales, average prices, and cars sold metrics.
Interactive Dashboard: Designed an interactive dashboard featuring:
Sales trends and growth analysis
Distribution of sales by body style and color
Geographical sales distribution by dealer region
Detailed sales data grid
This project was a fantastic opportunity to enhance my skills in data analytics and visualization, and I'm excited to apply these insights to drive business growth.
